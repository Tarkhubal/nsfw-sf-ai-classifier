# Here is the folder structure of the project

```basch
nsfw-sfw-ai-classifier
├───execute
└───train
    └───dataset
        ├───nsfw
        └───sfw
```

You can add images in the `execute` folder to classify them, and in the `train/dataset` folder to train the AI.

You will probably need to rebuild the folder tree if you want to train the AI with your own images (due to GitHub limitations, I can't upload empty folders).
